# Email OTP Verification Implementation

## Overview
Implemented email OTP verification functionality in the BookingDetailsModal component to verify user email addresses before completing bookings.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend (Already Existed)
The backend already had the necessary email OTP endpoints:
- `POST /api/auth/send-email-otp` - Sends OTP to user's email
- `POST /api/auth/verify-email-otp` - Verifies the OTP code
- `POST /api/auth/resend-email-otp` - Resends OTP if needed

### 2. Frontend API Layer (`/frontend/src/lib/api.ts`)
Added three new methods to the `api.auth` object:
```typescript
sendEmailOTP: async (userId: string) => {
  const response = await apiRequest('POST', '/api/auth/send-email-otp', { userId });
  return response.json();
},

verifyEmailOTP: async (userId: string, otp: string) => {
  const response = await apiRequest('POST', '/api/auth/verify-email-otp', { userId, otp });
  return response.json();
},

resendEmailOTP: async (userId: string) => {
  const response = await apiRequest('POST', '/api/auth/resend-email-otp', { userId });
  return response.json();
}
```

### 3. BookingDetailsModal Component (`/frontend/src/components/BookingDetailsModal.tsx`)

#### New Features:
1. **Two-Step Process**:
   - Step 1: User enters name and email
   - Step 2: User verifies email with OTP code

2. **State Management**:
   - `step`: Tracks current step ('details' | 'verify')
   - `otp`: Stores the 6-digit OTP entered by user
   - `countdown`: 60-second countdown for resend button
   - `userId`: Stores user ID for OTP operations

3. **User Flow**:
   - User fills in name and email â†’ Clicks "Send Verification Code"
   - System saves profile and sends OTP to email
   - User receives email with 6-digit code
   - User enters code in verification screen
   - System verifies code and completes booking

4. **Features**:
   - 6-digit OTP input with auto-formatting (digits only)
   - 60-second cooldown before allowing resend
   - Visual feedback with loading states
   - Back button to edit details if needed
   - Helpful messages and instructions
   - Email sent notification
   - Code expiry warning (5 minutes)

5. **UI Improvements**:
   - Responsive design for mobile and desktop
   - Clear step-by-step process
   - Loading spinners during async operations
   - Toast notifications for success/error states
   - Visual shield icon for security indication

## User Experience Flow

1. **Initial Modal**: User sees booking details form with name and email fields
2. **Submit Details**: User fills form and clicks "Send Verification Code"
3. **Email Sent**: System sends OTP email and shows verification screen
4. **Enter OTP**: User enters 6-digit code from email
5. **Verify**: User clicks "Verify & Complete Booking"
6. **Success**: Booking is completed with verified email

## Error Handling

- Invalid email format validation
- OTP length validation (must be 6 digits)
- Expired OTP detection
- Network error handling
- User-friendly error messages via toast notifications

## Security Features

- OTP expires after 5 minutes
- Rate limiting via 60-second resend cooldown
- Email verification before booking completion
- Secure token-based API communication

## Testing Notes

- The backend email service uses Resend API
- For testing, check backend logs for OTP codes if email doesn't arrive
- Ensure RESEND_API_KEY is set in backend environment variables
- Email is sent from 'team@altq.in'

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Add SMS OTP as alternative verification method
- Show masked email (e.g., a***@gmail.com) in verification step
- Add "Change Email" button in verification step
- Implement auto-submit when 6 digits are entered
- Add animation transitions between steps
